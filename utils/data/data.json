On one side is the modern bathroom, which has a bathtub, and through which you can access a spacious terrace. To the other side of the hall is the living space. It has 2 glass doors that open to a balcony overlooking the street. It\u2019s a fabulous space and very minimalist. The kitchen isn\u2019t equipped, but has all the major appliances. The rest of the room is furnished with a bed and a small desk. \n\nIn east London, your studio flat in Tower Hamlets is located right on the edge of Mile End Park. This is a sprawling space with paths to stroll or jog. The park also has lots of activities to keep you busy. There is a climbing wall, a karting track, leisure center and an outdoor stadium. You can cut through the park and arrive at Queen Mary University in 10 minutes. Mideastern cuisine is served up at multiple restaurants along your street, and there are plenty of bars and pubs closer to the school. You can pick up every day groceries at the Nica Local. It\u2019s beside the post office just 3 minutes away.",

          "description": "This spacious studio flat in the top floor of a Victorian-style building on Penywern Road, in West Earl's Court, has everything you might need in a single space. Quite literally! The open-concept floor plan brings living, dining, sleeping and kitchen areas together to make the most out of the somewhat limited space, leaving only the modern private bathroom with shower hidden from view. A fully-equipped kitchen sits in one of the corners of the flat, with a stovetop, oven, microwave and a small fridge. On the opposite side of the room, a futon can be used as a sofa during the day or as a double bed at night.\n\nThe flat is located in the heart of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, very close to the former site of the Earl's Court Exhibition Centre. There are plenty of coffee houses and restaurants nearby, and in less than 5 minutes you can be at Old Brompton Road or Earl's Court Road, conducting important research on which pub serves the best pint. It's worth noting that Stamford Bridge is only a 20-minute walk away, if you're a fan of the beautiful game or Chelsea FC in particular.",
